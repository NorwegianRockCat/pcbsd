Before asking a question on the forums or starting a new thread, first use the search utility to see if a similar thread already exists.
If one does, you can add to the conversation by using the “Reply” button.
If you find a thread useful, feel free to click the “Thanks” button to let the original poster know that you benefited from their knowledge.


If a similar thread does not already exist, review the forum categories to determine which one is the best fit for your post.
When creating a new thread, use a useful “Title” name to describe your problem or question--remember, other users may be researching a similar issue and you want them to find your thread.
Include enough details in your message so that others can quickly understand what you are experiencing--otherwise, they will have to ask you additional questions to understand your problem.
Make sure you are subscribed to your thread so that you will receive a notification when someone responds to it.


You can ask a question by clicking on the “New Thread” button in the forum category that most closely matches your question.
For example, if you are having problems with your video settings, you should create a new thread in the “Graphics” Card forum.
If you do not see a category that matches your question, try the “General Support” category.


In addition to the forums available from the PC-BSD® Forums website, the following forums may assist you in troubleshooting your PC-BSD® system: 

- : many PC-BSD® problems are related to the underlying FreeBSD operating system.
  The FreeBSD forums are very active and full of useful information that can apply to your PC-BSD® system.

- : this forum is in Polish and is specific to PC-BSD®, forums for the other BSD operating systems are also available at . 


IRC Channel
===========

Like many open source projects, PC-BSD® has an  to connect supporters and users.
To get connected, use the following information in your IRC client: 

- **Server name:** irc.freenode.net 

- **Channel name:** #pcbsd (note that the # is required) 

 has an IRC category where you can find PBIs for IRC clients.
If you do not wish to install an IRC client, you can instead use the . 

IRC is a great way to chat with other users and get answers to your questions.
A few things to keep in mind if you ask a question on IRC: 

- Most of the regular users are always logged in, even when they are away from their computer or are busy doing other computing tasks.
  If you do not get an answer right away, do not get mad, leave the channel and never come back again.
  Stick around for a while to see if anyone responds.
  

- IRC users represent many different time zones.
  It is quite possible that it is late at night or very early in the morning for some users when you ask a question.
  

- Do not post error messages in the channel as the IRC software will probably kick you out for flooding and it is considered to be bad etiquette.
  Instead, use a pasting service such as  and refer to the URL on channel.
  

- Be polite and do not demand that others answer your question.
  

- It is considered rude to DM (direct message) someone who does not know you.
  If no one answers your question, do not start DMing people you do not know.
  

- The first time you join a channel, it is okay to say hi and introduce yourself.
  


Mailing Lists
=============

Mailing lists are a handy way to discuss problems, solutions, and requested features as they create a searchable archive of discussions.
The PC-BSD® Project offers the following  to cover a wide variety of discussion topics:

Anyone can read the archives of a list.
If you wish to send an email to a mailing list, you will need to first subscribe to the list.
